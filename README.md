# Resellient-Industry-5.0--KG aware Cybersecurity Intelligence Modelling
This repository contains the implementation of GRICS (Graph-Integrated Retrieval for Industry-Centric Security) — a Knowledge-Graph-Augmented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) framework designed for explainable, human–AI collaborative threat reasoning in Industry 5.0 cyber-physical systems.

GRICS
Graph-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Explainable Threat Reasoning in Industry 5.0


## Overview

GRICS (Graph-Integrated Retrieval for Industry-Centric Security) is a Knowledge-Graph-Augmented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) framework designed for:

Explainable cyber threat reasoning

Multi-hop attack path analysis

Human–AI collaborative cybersecurity decision support

Industry 5.0 cyber-physical systems

GRICS integrates structured cybersecurity knowledge (CVE, CWE, CAPEC, MITRE ATT&CK) with a dual-LLM architecture to enable interpretable, ontology-grounded reasoning across IT and OT environments.

## Core Contributions

-  Graph-aware RAG for cyber-physical environments
- BRIDG-ICS ontology operationalization
- Dual-LLM architecture (Symbolic Retrieval + Answer Synthesis)
- Hybrid symbolic + embedding fallback retrieval
- Multi-hop reasoning (up to 5 hops)
- Quantitative explainability metrics
- Adversarial robustness evaluation

## System Architecture

GRICS follows a structured two-stage pipeline:

# Symbolic Retrieval Stage

- Natural language query → Cypher generation
- Executed over Neo4j BRIDG-ICS knowledge graph
- Retrieves interpretable subgraphs
# Answer Generation Stage

- Retrieved graph evidence → LLM synthesis
- Produces grounded explanations
- Preserves reasoning chains (e.g., CVE → CWE → CAPEC → ATT&CK)

# Embedding Fallback

If symbolic execution returns empty results:
- Semantic similarity search identifies anchor nodes
- Refined Cypher query reattempted

## Security Aware Knowledge Graph

The BRIDG-ICS knowledge graph integrates:

- CVE, CWE, CAPEC, MITRE ATT&CK, Industrial assets (IT & OT)

- Communication flows,Risk attributes, pExploit, riskWeight, controlStrength, costAttack

This enables:

- Vulnerability Propagation Risk (VPR) computation
- ATT&CK technique reachability
- Cross-layer attack path reasoning

## Evaluation Summary

GRICS is evaluated on:

- CTI-RCM (2021, 2024)
- CTI-ATE benchmark
- Multi-hop reasoning (1–5 hops)
- Explainability metrics:
- Hallucination Rate (HR)
- Query Violation Rate (QVR)
- Schema Consistency Rate (SCR)
- Adversarial robustness:
- Attack Success Rate (ASR)
- Tokens per Query (TPQ)

  # Results demonstrate:

- Improved multi-hop stability
-  Reduced hallucination under increasing relational depth
- Strong grounding in symbolic retrieval
- Higher interpretability compared to baseline LLMs
